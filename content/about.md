*Well, since you've asked...*

I am currently a Computer Science student at University of Exeter.

As you've seen on the Home page, I like to do hacking in my spare time. You can see some of my projects in the [**posts section**](/posts)

## tools/languages:

*Thought it would be useful to give an indication of my proficiency in each language*

*Some of these provide no indication at all (like GoLang) as the 2 projects I've tacked were MASSIVE hence I feel quite confident with the language. Just ask for more details.*
